HMP Documentation
=================
Welcome to the `HMP <https://github.com/GWeindel/hmp>`_ documentation.

HMP implements the Hidden Multivariate Pattern method that seeks to identify trial-wise sequences of neural events in multivariate time-series data such as EEG or MEG. For more information on the method see the accompanying `paper <https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00400/125469/Trial-by-trial-detection-of-cognitive-events-in>`_.

This documentation is designed to help you easily navigate and find the information you need.
