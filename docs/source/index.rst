HMP Documentation
=================
Welcome to the `HMP <https://github.com/GWeindel/hmp>`_ documentation. 

HMP implements the Hidden Multivariate Pattern method that seeks to indentify trial-wise sequences of neural events in multivariate time-series data such as EEG or MEG. For more information on the method see the accompanying `paper <https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00400/125469/Trial-by-trial-detection-of-cognitive-events-in>`_.



This documentation is designed to help you easily navigate and find the information you need. It is organized into the following four sections:


:doc:`installation`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :doc:`installation` section provides an overview of HMP's purpose and functionality.

:doc:`notebooks/index`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :doc:`notebooks/index` section provides demos and examples of the HMP package in action. These notebooks are designed to help you understand how to use HMP effectively, showcasing its capabilities through practical examples.
